							<p> My interest in IT comes from its applications and possible future applications in life. I love the idea that I can skip my Spotify on my PlayStation using my phone. Concepts such as the smart house where I can prewarm my shower from an app for when I get home; or ordering a click and collect because my fridge recognizes that I snacked on the cheese at midnight again. Future applications that blow my mind is taking the human consciousness and saving it to a digital space. In the show “Ghost in the Shell” They upload their consciousness to the internet to then download into cyborg bodies for when their real body becomes sick or hurt. The real key to immortality.<p>
							<p> My experience in IT is basically just the interactions with the things around me. People think I am good with computers because I use a VPN and can download things. But that is about where it stops.<p>
							<p> My choice to come to RMIT was simply that of ease. When deciding which course, I wanted to do RMIT was one of the only ones offering it in an online model. I am aware of its recognition for being a top tech school, but that was more research after enrolling.<p>
							<p> What I expect to learn from my studies is a general foundation of many IT fields. From understanding basic concepts of machine learning, to coding and app development. I want to be able to walk away with a decent skillset and better idea and understanding of where I want this to go. </p>
