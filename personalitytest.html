								<p> The results of these tests come as no suprise to me. I am an underacheing introvert who strives off being creative. I know that if I ever apply myself to anything that I would excell in it, but usually get bored before that </P>
									<P> As for how these results reflect on how I would respond to a team environment I'm not sure. I will most likely stay in the background and get done what needs to be done and probably wont raise my hand for extra respsonsibility or if there is anything I am not happy with </P>
									<p> When regarding these results and putting me into groups, having a polar opitise personality won't result in anything good. Overly positive and flambouant people make me shut down even worse. </p>
									<p> As for the valadility of the results, I feel like there is some psuedo science (phycic) 'fakeness' to them. Like ask a bunch of open questions and you will end up getting the result you want </p>
